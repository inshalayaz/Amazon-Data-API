# Amazon-Data-API
Using this API you can extract all the information that is available on amazon. You can search for products, get its details and can use the data available on amazon to create a dropshipping website or somthing more amazing.
This is just a simple project I made for fun I you want me to improve it so it could be used without any problem you can let me know.

At the moment it can't be use directly so all you will have to do is to download the folder on your local machine get your API KEY and use on local machine or host the API on heruku to use it.
